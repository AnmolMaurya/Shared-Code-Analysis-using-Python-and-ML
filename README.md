# Shared-Code-Analysis-using-Python-and-ML
Shared code analysis, also called similarity analysis, is the process by which we compare two malware samples by estimating the percentage of precompilation source code they share.

In reverse engineering, shared code analysis helps identify samples that can be analyzed together (because they were generated from the same malware toolkit or are different versions of the same malware family), which can determine whether the same developers could have been responsible for a group of malware samples.

**In this talk, youâ€™ll learn to use these techniques to do the following:**

*-Identify new malware families that come from the same malware toolkits or were written by the same attackers.*

*-Determine code similarity between a new sample and previously seen samples.*

*-Visualize malware relationships to better understand code-sharing patterns between malware samples and to communicate your results to others.*

*-Use two proof-of-concept tools I built for this book that implement these ideas and allow you to see malware shared code relationships.*
